Three Trends in Heroes of Pymoli which I had observed while analyzing the given data are as follows:

1.while doing the gender analysis, it was found that the number of 'Male' were exceedingly high as compared to female or others. Hence we can conclude based on this data that "gaming" is more popular amongst males.

2.While analyzing the data by'Age', it was found that the 63% of the total gamers were within the Age Range of '20 to 24'. Therefore we can conclude based on this data that people between the ages of 20 to 24 years are more fond of gaming

3.The third trend that was clearly visible while analysing the data by 'Age' was that the 'Age Range of the Players' was from '7 to 47' years which was skewed toward the younger side which indicates that gaming is more popular amongst the ages under 50 years.
